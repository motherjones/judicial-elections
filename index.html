			<h1>Politicians in Black Robes</h1>
			<span class="byline">By AJ Vicens and Tasneem Raja October 2014</span>
			<p>Spending on state judicial elections, especially independent, hard-to-track spending has exploded over the last decade. Judges and fair courts advocates say that’s a bad thing.</p>

		<section class="section-panel">
			<div class="section-graphic"><img src="img/38.png"/></div>
			<p>Most people probably don’t even think about judicial elections, but judges in 38 states will face voters at some point in their time on the bench, whether in the initial election or through retention elections.

			<p>The money involved was typically measured in the hundreds or thousands for many years. But in the late 1980s, a guy named Karl Rove began to recognize the power of state judicial politics in Texas. Rove’s model really took off in the 1990s, with the total fundraising to state judicial candidates jumping to more than $206 million in the 2000s from $86 million in the 90s.<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KgJ8pHxwPvtxLH4bQLsxkpXxt1Gbj5JXVAl8Ho8c2ys/pubhtml" target="_blank">Data</a>

			<div class="section-graphic"><img src="img/top_ten_states_conts.png"/></div>
			<p>Some states have seen a lot more of this than others. Alabama has by far the vast majority of contributions to judicial candidates since 2000 ($48 million compared to the second-place state, Ohio, which saw $27.6 million).

			<p>But as time goes on, larger portions are being spent independent of specific candidates or campaigns. “We ask courts to be fair and impartial, not political," says Bert Brandenberg, executive director of Justice at Stake<a href="http://www.justiceatstake.org/">. "[Chasing campaign dollars and the infusion of independent spending] tears away at the insulation around the courts, turning them into politicians in black robes."

			<p>Tracking that independent spending is hard to get. A recent analysis by the National Institute on Money in State Politics gave 26 states a failing grade for independent spending disclosure requirements. The grade is based on how strictly a state requires reporting of independent expenditures, electioneering ads and the target of the spender.

			<p>Money in state judicial races is also growing at the lower-court level. A recent project by the National Institute on Money in State Politics found more than $55 million raised by lower-court judicial candidates during the 2011-12 cycle.

		<section class="section-panel">
			<div class="section-graphic"><img src="img/top_10_overall.png"/></div>
			<p>Again, some states have more of this than others. The top 10 states over the last decade, in terms of state judicial campaign contributions and estimated outside spending, account for nearly $200 million dollars.</p>

		<section class="section-panel">
			<div class="section-graphic"><img src="img/super_spenders.png"/></div>
			<p>A relative few super spenders are dominating the independent spending game. Groups like the US Chamber of Commerce, the Republican and Democratic parties in Michigan and others have spent tens of millions on state judicial races since 2000. More recently, the Republican State Leadership Committee has been spending a lot of money in places like North Carolina.</p>

			<div class="section-graphic"><img src="img/tv_spending_yr.png"/></div>
			<p>The independent money is usually used to fund television advertising. The amount of money spent on state high court campaign television ads has more than tripled over the last decade.</p>

			<div class="section-graphic"><img src="img/tv_ad_shot.png"/></div>
			<p>Judicial campaigns were relatively congenial over the years, with many judges trying to stay out of the political mud. But with the rise in independent money fueling more and more TV ads, the tone gets a lot nastier.<em style="color:blue">See others here.</em></p>

		<section class="section-panel">
			<div class="section-graphic"><img src="img/sandra_dayOconnor.jpg"/></div>
			<p>A prominent critic of the money in state judicial elections says even the perception of bias undermines the whole system. “Judicial elections pose a serious threat to judicial independence, and to the public’s perception of that independence,” says retired US Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor. “If judicial decisions are in fact not fair and impartial – or even if they are perceived as being biased – the basis of support for our courts crumbles.”</p>
