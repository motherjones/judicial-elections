		<h1>Politicians in Black Robes</h1>
			<p>Spending on state judicial elections, especially independent, hard-to-track spending has exploded over the last decade. Judges and fair courts advocates say that’s a bad thing.</p>

	<!-- panel 1 -->	
	<section class="section-panel">

		<p>Most people probably don’t even think about judicial elections, but judges in 39 states will face voters at some point in their time on the bench, whether in the initial election or through retention elections.

		<p>But good data about how independent spending on judicial races is hard to get. A recent analysis by the National Institute on Money in State Politics gave 26 states a failing grade for independent spending disclosure requirements. The grade is based on how strictly a state requires reporting of independent expenditures, electioneering ads and the target of the spender.

	<!-- panel 3 -->
	<section class="section-panel">
		<img src="../img/top_ten_states_conts.png"/>
		<p>In some places lax disclosure laws overlap with incredible spending on judicial examples. Alabama has seen by far the vast majority of contributions to judicial candidates since 2000 ($48 million compared to the second-place state, Ohio, which saw $27.6 million). In these places it's nearly impossible to know how much money was actually spent.

	<!-- panel 4 -->
	<section class="section-panel">
		<img src="../img/1990s_v_2000s.png"/>
		<p>This wasn't a major problem until the late 80s when a guy named Karl Rove started <a href="file://localhost/Users/avicens/workspace/mojo-news-apps-2014/judicial-elections/main/index.html">targeting judicial races in Texas</a>. In the 1990s it really took off, with the total fundraising jumping to more than $206 million in the 2000s from $86 million in the 90s. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KgJ8pHxwPvtxLH4bQLsxkpXxt1Gbj5JXVAl8Ho8c2ys/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">Data</a>

	<!-- panel 5 -->
	<section class="section-panel">
		<img src="../img/pct_change_conts.png"/>
		<p>As the money continues to increase, larger portions are being spent independent of specific candidates or campaigns. “We ask courts to be fair and impartial, not political," says Bert Brandenberg, executive director of <a href="http://www.justiceatstake.org/">Justice at Stake</a>. "[Chasing campaign dollars and the infusion of indepdentent spending] tears away at the insulation around the courts, turning them into politicians in black robes."

	<!-- panel 6 -->
	<section class="section-panel">
		<img src="../img/top_10_overall.png"/>
		<p>This is a bigger deal in some states. The top 10 states over the last decade, in terms of state judicial campaign contributions and estimated outside spending, account for nearly $200 million dollars. </p>
	</section>

	<!-- panel 7 -->
	<section class="section-panel">
		<img src="../img/super_spenders.png"/>
		<p>A relative few super spenders are dominating the independent spending game. Groups like the US Chamber of Commerce, the Republican and Democratic parties in Michigan and others have spent tens of millions on state judicial races since 2000.</p>

	<!-- panel 8 -->
	<section class="section-panel">
		<img src="../img/tv_ad_shot.png"/>
		<p>A lot of this indepentend spending goes toward TV ads, which get nastier with more independent spending. <em style="color:blue">See others here.</em></p>

	<!-- panel 9 -->
	<section class="section-panel">
		<img src="../img/tv_spending_yr.png"/>
		<p>Spending on these types of ads has exploded over the last few years, reaching nearly $34 million in the 2011-12 cycle.</p>
